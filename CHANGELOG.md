## Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 1.7 - 2018-06-06
- IFBMoMSolver now working with the connected domains (Jacobi - Alg. 7).

## 1.6 - 2018-06-06
- IFBMoMSolver now working with the Adaptive MBF solver again (Alg. 14)
  for disconnected array elements.

## 1.5 - 2018-06-05
- Work in progress: Got now the IFBMoMsolver + JackitSolver going for
  disconnected domains at least.

## 1.4 - 2018-06-05
- Work in progress: Added now example-3 (radiating bow-tie array example).

## 1.3 - 2018-06-05
- Something not quite right still ...

## 1.2 - 2018-06-04
- Working on interconnected CBFM solver. Promote before biggish refactoring.

## 1.1 - 2018-06-01
- Did quite a lot of work on interconnected domains (parsing *.out file for geometry
  and basis function setup).
- TO-DO: Still working on treatment of interconnected structures in CBFM solver.

## 1.0 - 2018-05-31
- First promote - took some of the existing work done for /feko-connect and /harp
  (excluding solver details from the latter)
